`commutable` is a library for Jupyter Notebook operations, helping to enable
history stored as a series of immutable notebooks.

## Principles

* **A notebook document is immutable**. It is never mutated in-place.
* Changes to a notebook document are encapsulated into **operations** that take a previous version and return a new one.
* History is represented as a **list of states**, with past on one end, the present on the other, and an index that can back up into 'undo states'.
* Modifying a notebook document causes any **future states to be thrown away**.

## Roadmap

Provide utilities for working with IPython/Jupyter notebooks under their common
operations.

* [x] Convert from on disk v4 format to in-memory format
* [ ] Convert from v3 to v4
* [ ] Design cell operations
* [ ] Convert from in-memory to disk format
